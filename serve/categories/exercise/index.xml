      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;my-new-bike&#34;&gt;My New Bike&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I try to get more heathy, I have to increase my physical activity. My first attempt at an increase, was walking. I really enjoy walking the dog, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/plantar-fasciitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354846&#34; title=&#34;Plantar fasciitis&#34;&gt;plantar fasciitis&lt;/a&gt; has been a hinderance. For anyone who has not suffered with plantar fasciitis, I can best describe it as walking with a nail through my heel. I spoke to my doctor, and biking does not stress my feet. So I am now trying to take up biking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I had an old bike (purchased in the 90s), I could not get it working. I needed a replacement. Because I am just starting out with biking, I can&#39;t spend a lot. After much &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNPXndn9_Hk&#34; title=&#34;Walmart $299 Schwinn Santis Mountain Bike with Hydraulic brakes&#34;&gt;searching&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to buy the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.walmart.com/ip/29-Schwinn-Men-s-Santis-Mountain-Bike/730625518&#34; title=&#34;29in Schwinn Men&#39;s Santis Mountain Bike&#34;&gt;Schwinn Santis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me about 15 minutes to put the bike together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 10 miles in, I love it. I would recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
