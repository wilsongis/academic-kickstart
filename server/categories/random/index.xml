      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;is-this-who-we-now-are&#34;&gt;Is This Who We Now Are?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw this headline this week &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-15/children-border-sanitary-conditions-flores-agreement-9th-circuit&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Court upholds ruling that children held at border must have adequate food, bedding, sanitation&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. Intellectually I knew thing were bad in the detention facilities. The fact that a judge has to order the government to provide clean water, food, and sanitary conditions is reprehensible. I have no faith that this order is being followed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am ashamed that this is where we are at as a country.&lt;/p&gt;
