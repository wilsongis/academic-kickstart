My heart stopped twice before I was airlifted to a hospital with a Cath Lab. I boarded the helicopter not knowing if I would see my wife and kids in life again.\nOn the whole helicopter ride I did not close my eyes for fear of not opening them again. I made sure that the paramedic knew to tell my wife and kids that I love them. My thoughts on that ride were chaotic but I tried to find peace. The pilot opened the window so I could get air, and I thought about how dieing with fresh air blowing on my face might not be so bad. After 30 minutes we made it to the hospital.\nI was immediately rushed to the Cath lab and got a stint placed. It provided relief and the doctor was positive about my prognosis. I was wheeled to the ICU where I finally got to see my wife. She had to drive over an hour to the hospital not knowing if I made it.\nAfter an hour seeing my wife, the chest pains began again. The stint had collapsed. Turns out I was one of the rate people who the common blood thinners do know work. Again, I was rushed to the Cath lab and a stint was placed again. This time it took.\nI did not sleep that night or most of the next day due to fear of closing my eyes. It did not help that my chest wall was blistered due to the shocking used to restart my heart.\nAll told this \u0026ldquo;adventure\u0026rdquo; lasted approximately 12 hours. I believe strongly that the ramifications of the heart attack will linger for the rest of my life. My only risk factor is high cholesterol, which was diagnosed Monday. My diet will be one of the major changes. Another will have to be stress.\nEven as I write about managing stress, I am struggling to go to sleep because I just feel off.

Hertz created sparks that were radiated though wide-band loaded dipoles. In this time period, short, wide-band pulses were the easiest to create (Win, Dardari, Molisch, Wiesbeck, \u0026amp; Jinyun Zhang, 2009). Interest continued in UWB though the 1970’s. Research in UWB expanded greatly in 2002. In February 2002, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued the first authorization for UWB (Andrews, 2003). Similar to Bluetooth and BLE, UWB frequencies between 3.1 - 10.6 Ghz are available for unlicensed use (Win et al., 2009).\nAs noted previously, the 2002 FCC decision regarding UWB spectrum has created renewed interest in UWB research. Research interest has not translated to significant consumer adoption. It should be noted that unlike BLE, UWB has not become a common place technology. UWB lacks the standard specifications of BLE. This has hampered the broad consumer adoption of the technology (Zafari, Gkelias, \u0026amp; Leung, 2017).\nSome of the advantages of UWB (Ridolfi, Van de Velde, Steendam, \u0026amp; De Poorter, 2018) include:\n bandwidth is over 110 Mbps (up to 480 Mbps) Low Cost, Low Power Large bandwidth and the high time resolution  Of particular interest to IoT and Industry 4.0 research is the large bandwidth and the high time resolution. This feature can mitigate indoor environmental factors such as non-line-of-sight reception, multipath, and multiple access interference. Non-line-of-sight reception is due to UWB being able to penetration through obstacles. The penetration is due to the fact that UWB has large frequency spectrum that includes low frequency parts as well as high frequency components (Gezici and Poor, 2009, #97855).\nMultipath (Figure 1) is a common issue when working with GPS systems. Multipath can be defined as:\n “The term multipath is derived from the fact that a signal transmitted from a GPS satellite can follow a ‘multiple’ number of propagation ‘paths’ to the receiving antenna. This is possible because the signal can be reflected back to the antenna off surrounding objects, including the earth’s surface.”\n Figure 1: Multipath Example\nGPS measurements (as with UWB) are based on the transmission speed and accurate timekeeping. Signals experiencing multipath are measuring the signal assuming that the signal is traveling in the straight path to the receiver. In actuality, the signal is following the reflected path. This introduces error into the position calculations. The very wide bandwidth and pulses used be UWB mitigate the effects of a dense multipath environments, such as indoors (Win \u0026amp; Scholtz, 1998).\nUWB is resistant to multiple access interference. This is interference from other UWB and electronic signals. The very small power spectral densities of UWB reduces the impact of interference (Hu \u0026amp; Beaulieu, 2004).\nThe main disadvantages to UWB include (Kshetrimayum, 2009):\n Interference Complex signal processing Bit synchronization time  Although UWB is resistant to outside interference, it has the potential to interfere with other electronic signals. WLAN devices working at 5.150–5.825 GHz and 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical bands are potentially susceptible (Kshetrimayum, 2009). Particularly in a noisy environment, complex signal processing is required by UWB. This processing allows a UWB device to be able to recover data. UWB signals are transferred in pulses. These pulses occur in extremely rapid succession. With intermittent transmission, performance can be significantly impacted (Kshetrimayum, 2009).\n1In this document, I use the term Ultrawide Band. In the literature, it is also referred to as Ultra Wide Band, Ultra Wideband, Ultra-Wide Band, Ultra-Wideband, and several other derivations. I use Ultrawide band as synonymous.↩\nReferences:\nAndrews, J. R. (2003). UWB signal sources, antennas and propagation. public.hofstragroup.com, 15, 439-440.\nHu, B., \u0026amp; Beaulieu, N. C.

Although I love the service, it is one of my most costly subs at $15 a month. I started to search for alternatives.\nI stumbled across a review of Overdrive and thought to give it a try. Overdrive allows me to checkout ebooks and addio books via my local library. In the month I have been using the app. I have been pleasantly surprised. There is a wide selection of both audio and ebooks available. The books I have listened to have been of equal quality to what I was used to on Audible. The Overdrive app, loke the Audible app, allows me to speed the playbay. This is a function that I consider essential.\nThe only \u0026ldquo;complaint\u0026rdquo; I have is the fact that many popular ebooks and auduos have waiting lists. It is not the apps fault, it is a limit on the library's digital subscription. Overdrive has a feature to place a book on hold, estimate your wait time, and check the book out for you when it becomes available.\nOverdrive has made it to my home screen. i cannot recommend it enough.\n","date":1566525615,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566525622,"objectID":"98227e49d46634e76972b09a70757563","permalink":"https://minimalworkflow.com/post/overdrive/","publishdate":"2019-08-22T21:00:15-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/overdrive/","section":"post","summary":"Replacing Audible In the past several years, too many of the apps, services, and software I consider indispensable have gone to a subscription model.

Wilson"],"categories":["dissertation"],"content":"Barriers and Issues in Additive Manufacturing In reviewing various literature regarding additive manufacturing, there are several issues regarding wide-spread adoption in the aerospace, automotive and biomedical industries. The key issues can be summarized as making, material, metrology, and market (Tofail et al., 2018).\nOf particular interest is metrology. According to (Muelaner, 2017), metrology is defined as the science of measurement. The literature refers to metrology as the various measurements required for quality control and assurance (Townsend, Senin, Blunt, Leach, \u0026amp; Taylor, 2016).\nAt present, the metrology processes can be classified as two types, in situ and off line. In situ measurements are those collected and analyzed in the build chamber. Off line measurements are those that are collected in the chamber and analyzed off site. Generally, in situ analysis is non-destructive but is not as thorough as the more comprehensive and destructive off site measurements (Tofail et al., 2018). Basically in situ is instant but limited and off site is slow, destructive, and comprehensive.\nAccording to the literature, the metrology issues that are barriers to widespread adoption (Tofail et al., 2018) can be summarized as:\n• Need for real time in line quality control and assurance • Process monitoring and control towards optimization • High level of customization of the techniques for in-situ measurements • High accuracy and measurement processing speeds\nBased on the outlined issues, I believe that there are two possible paths for my dissertation, machine learning and image rectification. In the current process, imagery is captured in situ and analyzed off site. Machine learning, more specifically, image recognition, offered a possible path to quick, near real-time analysis. A project would include the development of a training datasets, ML model selection, model tuning, and experimentation. A more expansive and detailed proposal can be developed if data is available.\nA second possible project would be based on the GIS process of image rectification. In GIS, image rectification is the process of manipulating aerial or satellite imagery to accurately represent the Earth[’s surface. Basically, a pixel on an image represents a discrete point (coordinate) on the Earth. I believe that is might be interesting to look at the possibility of using similar techniques to capture images of the additive build process and be able to take measurements as the item is being printed. The experimental part of the project would be the development of a camera configuration and rectification process to take the level of accurate images needed for additive manufacturing. This idea is very speculative. I do believe that I could accomplish much of the data collection needed with the prosumer 3D printers that I have access to on a daily basis. Cameras maybe an issue, although I would be tempted to try a mobile device as a camera system.\nOf the two ideas, I am more drawn to the first. I feel that this project could have concrete implications for additive manufacturing. Although interesting, I believe the second project is entirely speculative on my part.\nReferences:\nMuelaner, J.

Spatial data (multiple measurements) consisting of latitude and longitude coordinates of positions reported by these six GPS-enabled mobile devices were collected at nine different physical locations (control points). The results of the field data were ranked and compared through the use of one scientific and two realistic measuring protocols. The scientific protocol was designed to simulate standard scientific experimental practices (a controlled experiment). The realistic protocols were designed to simulate daily usage of mobile devices (holding a mobile phone at around waist level). In this preliminary study, it was discovered that various mobile devices perform differently in terms of AEE, RMSE, and CE. It also showed that the protocol is not a statistically significant contributing factor to the variation in the measurements in terms of accuracy nor precision. The device and the location are statistically significant contributing factors to the variation in the measurements in terms of accuracy and precision.
