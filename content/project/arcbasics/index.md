## The Purpose of ArcBasics

The purpose of this book is to introduce the reader to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and ArcGIS Desktop 10.1 or 10.2 by ESRI.

Over the years, I have worked with various GIS lessons, tutorials and how-to books, websites, and other resources. This book is a compilation of all the various "best practices" that I have learned. My goal is to help those new to GIS and ArcGIS to develop a solid foundation upon which to build.
