abstract: "GPS-enabled mobile devices are extremely popular today. Billions of such devices are currently in use. The application and research potentials of these devices are limitless, but how accurate are these devices? The research team used Average Euclidean Error (AEE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Central Error (CE) to define and calculate the accuracy and precision of twelve popular GPS-enabled mobiles devices in two different geographical regions in Middle Tennessee. Field data were collected, and the results were ranked and compared. A website and related algorithm were developed to facilitate potential future research. In this preliminary study, it was discovered that various mobile devices performed differently in terms of AEE, RMSE, and CE. Their performance also varied in different geographical regions in terms of both (AEE, RMSE, and CE) values and ranking."
