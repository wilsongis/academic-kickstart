# Replacing Audible

For the past several years, I have been a faithful audible subscriber. I recently reviewed all of my various subscriptions and was stunned at the monthly cost. Although I love the service, I needed to cut back. At $15 a month, audible was one of my most expensive subs. in addition, too many of the apps and software I consider indispensable have also gone to a subscription model.
