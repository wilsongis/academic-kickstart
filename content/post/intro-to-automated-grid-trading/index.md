A Beginners Guid to Grid Trading

Over the past several months, I have decided to dip my toes into the world of cryptocurrency. One of the most interesting aspects of crypto for me was that of automated [grid trading](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/grid-trading.asp). Although, grid trading can require a significant learning curve, tools are available to utilize others expertise.

One of the more interesting tools I have found is [BitUniverse](https://rewards.bituniverse.org/get_grid_diamond_en.html?invite_code=TLgrFN1i&from=account). According to [BitUniverse on Medium](https://medium.com/@bituniverse2017/project-bituniverse-link-5c51167b3520), it is defined as:

> ... the leading all-in-one cryptocurrency portfolio manager and trading terminal in the world. With BitUniverse, you’ll enjoy an easier investment life due to our amazing functions, auto-tracking the balance and profit of your portfolio using API Key, checking realtime market price, analyzing the candlestick charts with 22 indicators, and also trading multiple exchanges using BitUniverse without switching from one client to another.

BitUniverse supports a variety of exchanges including [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com?rcode=yy76g6&lang=en_US), [Pionex](https://www.pionex.com/en-US?r=ZnXUvI6t), Binance, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Poliniex, [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/wilson_hpta), Kraken, Huobi, and others.

By using the API from an exchange you are using, you can utilize their pre-built AI Strategy bots or other user defined bots. BitUniverse also gives you the option to define your own manual grid. Particularly for a beginner, the AI Strategy bots and other bot templates are invaluable. For the rest of this post, I will focus on using the AI Strategy/Template bots.

Using AI Strategy/Template bots

1. to use BitUniverse, you need to sign up on the [BitUniverse website](https://rewards.bituniverse.org/get_grid_diamond_en.html?invite_code=TLgrFN1i&from=account). According to [BitUniverse on Medium](https://medium.com/@bituniverse2017/project-bituniverse-link-5c51167b3520).
2. Download the BitUniverse app from either the [Apple App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bituniverse-pro/id1450715704) (\$4.99) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bituniverse.portfolio&hl=en_US) (Free). (I use the iOS version.)
3. Add your exchange API to the BitUniverse app. I have personally used both [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com?rcode=yy76g6&lang=en_US), [Pionex](https://www.pionex.com/en-US?r=ZnXUvI6t). I prefer [Kucoin](https://www.kucoin.com?rcode=yy76g6&lang=en_US) because it is very friendly for small traders (<$20). Most of the available trading pairs in [Pionex](https://www.pionex.com/en-US?r=ZnXUvI6t) require a higher starting investment. Coinbase's trading fees are higher. **
