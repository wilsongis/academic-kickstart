# Is This Who We Now Are?

I saw this headline this week ["Court upholds ruling that children held at border must have adequate food, bedding, sanitation"](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-15/children-border-sanitary-conditions-flores-agreement-9th-circuit). I intellectually I knew thing were bad in the detention facilaties. The fact that a judge has to order that the government needs to provide clean water, food, and sanitary conditions is reprehensible. 

I am ashamed that this is where we are at as a country.
